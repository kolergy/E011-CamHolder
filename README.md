# E011-CamHolder - 11th whoop
EF-02 AIO Camera support for the EAchine E011 to be 3D printed 

The E011 can be converted into the cheapest FPV system with good flying performances, the Inductrix & the E010 are well known platform to do cheap FPV but these are very underpowered & requires a lot of mods for these to be good platforms. the E011 is a new quad that is slightly larger than the E010 but much more powerful because it is made to cary a figurine.

the camera angle is set to 15 degrees.
